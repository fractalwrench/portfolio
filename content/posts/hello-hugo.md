Hello World, Hello Hugo, and Hello Android!

This website originally started off as a portfolio site with some hacked together HTML. Over time, as I developed more Android applications, that workflow got a bit too complex. Therefore, I've moved the entire site over to the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator for the foreseeable future, which makes things a lot easier.

The original focus of the site was just a portfolio displaying Android, iOS, and other mobile projects which I'd completed during my time in the Bath/Bristol area. However, since editing markdown text is much easier than editing HTML, this blog post is likely to be the first of many! Stay tuned...

System.out.println("Hello Android!");
