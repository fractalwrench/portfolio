      <description>Hello World, Hello Hugo, and Hello Android!
This website originally started off as a portfolio site with some hacked together HTML. Over time, as I developed more Android applications, that workflow got a bit too complex. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved the entire site over to the Hugo static site generator for the foreseeable future, which makes things a lot easier.
The original focus of the site was just a portfolio displaying Android, iOS, and other mobile projects which I&amp;rsquo;d completed during my time in the Bath/Bristol area.</description>
