      <description>In golf, the smallest score wins.
Let&amp;rsquo;s apply that principle to Android. We&amp;rsquo;re going to play APK golf, and create the smallest possible app that can be installed on a device running Oreo.
Measuring a Baseline We&amp;rsquo;ll start off with a default app generated by Android Studio. Let&amp;rsquo;s create a keystore, sign the app, and measure the file size in bytes using stat -f%z $filename.
We&amp;rsquo;ll also install the APK on a Nexus 5x running Oreo, to ensure that everything works.</description>

      <description>Hello World, Hello Hugo, and Hello Android!
This website originally started off as a portfolio site with some hacked together HTML. Over time, as I developed more Android applications, that workflow got a bit too complex. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved the entire site over to the Hugo static site generator for the foreseeable future, which makes things a lot easier.
The original focus of the site was just a portfolio displaying Android, iOS, and other mobile projects which I&amp;rsquo;d completed during my time in the Bath/Bristol area.</description>
